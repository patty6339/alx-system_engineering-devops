## The Architecture



### Additional Elements and Their Purpose

1. **3 Firewalls**: Firewalls are added to control and monitor incoming and outgoing traffic to the web servers and database server. They help protect against unauthorized access and potential attacks.

2. **SSL Certificate**: An SSL certificate is used to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS, ensuring secure and encrypted communication between the client and the web servers. This protects sensitive data and improves user trust.

3. **3 Monitoring Clients**: Monitoring clients are added to collect data for monitoring services like Sumo Logic. They help track server performance, detect anomalies, and provide insights into the infrastructure's health.

### Monitoring and Data Collection

The monitoring server collects data from the monitoring clients on the web servers and database server. This data includes server metrics, application logs, and network traffic. The monitoring tool analyzes the collected data to provide real-time monitoring, alerting, and reporting capabilities.

To monitor the web server's QPS (Queries Per Second), you can configure the monitoring tool to collect and analyze the web server's access logs. This will provide insights into the server's traffic patterns and help identify any spikes or anomalies in QPS.

### Potential Issues

1. **SSL Termination at the Load Balancer**: Terminating SSL at the load balancer level can be an issue because it increases the load on the load balancer and may impact its performance. It also means that the web servers will receive unencrypted traffic, which could be a security concern if the communication between the load balancer and web servers is not secured.

2. **Single MySQL Server for Writes**: Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is a potential single point of failure. If the database server fails or becomes unavailable, the entire application will be affected. To mitigate this, you can implement a high availability (HA) solution for the database, such as a master-slave replication setup or a database cluster.

3. **Identical Server Components**: Having servers with the same components (database, web server, and application server) can be problematic if there is a software or configuration issue that affects all the servers simultaneously. To improve resilience, you can consider separating the components onto different servers or using different software versions on different servers.

By addressing these issues and implementing best practices for security, scalability, and high availability, you can enhance the overall reliability and performance of the web infrastructure.
