HTTPS SSL: Two Main Roles
Encryption:

Data Protection: SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encrypts data transmitted between a client and a server, ensuring that any data exchanged is secure and cannot be easily intercepted or read by unauthorized parties. This protects sensitive information such as login credentials, personal data, and financial transactions.
Authentication:

Trust Verification: SSL also authenticates the identity of the website and server, ensuring that the client is communicating with the intended, legitimate server. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker could impersonate a website to steal information.
Purpose of Encrypting Traffic
Data Confidentiality: Encrypting traffic ensures that any data transmitted over the network remains confidential and is only accessible to the intended recipient. This prevents eavesdropping and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
Data Integrity: Encryption helps ensure that the data has not been altered or tampered with during transmission. Any changes to the data will be detected, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the information exchanged.
Privacy: Encryption protects users' privacy by concealing their online activities and personal information from prying eyes, including hackers, ISPs, and other third parties.
SSL Termination
Definition: SSL termination refers to the process of decrypting SSL-encrypted traffic at a specific point, typically at a load balancer or reverse proxy server, before it is forwarded to the internal server.
Purpose: The main purposes of SSL termination are to offload the computational burden of SSL decryption from backend servers and to simplify the management of SSL certificates. This allows for better performance and easier scaling of web services, as the backend servers can handle unencrypted traffic, reducing their processing load.
By terminating SSL at a dedicated device or service, organizations can efficiently manage and secure their encrypted traffic while maintaining high performance and scalability.
