### What Bash Scripting Should Not Be Used For

Bash scripting is not well-suited for complex applications requiring:
- Extensive error handling and debugging
- Performance-intensive tasks
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Advanced data manipulation
- Large codebases and maintainability
- GUI applications

### What is an API

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other, facilitating the integration and interaction between various software components.

### What is a REST API

A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and is characterized by stateless communication, resource-based URLs, and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### What are Microservices

Microservices are an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled services. Each service is designed to perform a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, promoting flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.

### What is the CSV Format

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format is a simple file format used to store tabular data. Each line in a CSV file corresponds to a row in the table, and each field in the row is separated by a comma. It is widely used for data exchange and can be easily imported into spreadsheet applications.

### What is the JSON Format

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It uses a text format that is completely language-independent but uses conventions familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages.

### Pythonic Package and Module Name Style

- **Package Name Style**: Use short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used if it improves readability (e.g., `my_package`).
- **Module Name Style**: Use short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used if it improves readability (e.g., `my_module`).

### Pythonic Class Name Style

- **Class Name Style**: Use CapWords (CamelCase) convention, where each word starts with a capital letter and there are no underscores (e.g., `MyClassName`).

### Pythonic Variable Name Style

- **Variable Name Style**: Use lowercase words separated by underscores (snake_case) for readability (e.g., `my_variable_name`).

### Pythonic Function Name Style

- **Function Name Style**: Use lowercase words separated by underscores (snake_case) for readability (e.g., `my_function_name`).

### Pythonic Constant Name Style

- **Constant Name Style**: Use all uppercase letters with words separated by underscores (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT_NAME`).

### Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python

CapWords, also known as CamelCase, is significant in Python as it is the recommended style for naming classes. This convention helps distinguish class names from variable names, functions, and constants, enhancing code readability and maintainability.`
